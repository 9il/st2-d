Enhanced D syntax highlighting for Sublime Text 2
=================================================

This is a version of ST2's built-in D syntax
highlighter enhanced with various features that
have been added to the language since D 2.0. It
also fixes various bugs and oddities in the
original syntax highlighter.

Hopefully this will be merged into ST2 proper
at some point.

Files:

* D.tmLanguage.orig - the original syntax
  highlighter.
* D.tmLanguage.diff - differences between
  the enhanced highlighter and the original.
* D.tmLanguage - the enhanced syntax highlighter.
